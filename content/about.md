Hey my name is Rayaan, in my 4th year of CS @ WLU. Passionate about building
software that has a positive impact on people's lives. I love learning new technologies and using them to solve real-world problems.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, eating Shawarma, and cruising around on my Motorcycle.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub to discuss ideas, collaborate on projects, or just to say hello!
